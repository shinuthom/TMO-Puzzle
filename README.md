### Task 3

Business requirement: As a user I want to choose custom dates
so that I can view the trends within a specific period of time.

- Used material date-picker component for date selection

- Filtering is done using ngrx methods instead of doing from component

- Used Native date comparison for validation and filtering

- Added test cases for date validation (Updated all other test cases as part of Task 1)

- All constants are moved to separate file as part of Task 1
